        <p class="textjustify">Hi, I am Arnold, a jobseeker eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a dynamic company. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and possess above-average skills in window and web-based programming. I have proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, and VB.NET, along with fundamental knowledge of Python, Java, C++, and C#. While studying, I also accepted projects to create information systems for students from other schools, gaining practical experience in real-world applications of my skills. Upon graduation, I received multiple awards, including Best in Window-based Programming, Web-based Programming, Web Designing, Database Designing, System Analysis and Design, along with the Presidential Award for Community Service, Graphic and Layout Artist Award, and Programmer of the Year.</p>
        <p class="textjustify">
        I started my career at the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) - Magat River Integrated Irrigation System - Dam and Reservoir Division, where I also completed my on-the-job training. I was absorbed as a Data Encoder on September 19, 2020, and was awarded Rookie of the Year in 2021. On March 13, 2022, I was promoted to Computer Operator, and on October 19, 2022, I became a Records Assistant under government service, leading the NIA-MARIIS-DRD Personnel and Records Unit. I resigned on June 30, 2023, to support my guardian duties for my son while my wife is abroad.</p>
        <p class="textjustify">
        During my time at NIA-MARIIS-DRD, I developed strong organizational and technical skills, and even though my role was not directly related to my degree, I found ways to enhance my skills. I attended seminars for continued learning and automated various processes in the unit, improving service efficiency. Additionally, I assisted with computer maintenance and repairs and was part of both the Documented Information Team and Risk Management Team.</p>
        <p class="textjustify">
        I am now seeking a remote opportunity that aligns with my degree, where I can continue growing and contributing as a fast learner, adaptable team player, and responsible professional.
